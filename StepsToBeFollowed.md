To run the shell script (breeze.sh) that you provided, follow these steps:

Step 1: Ensure the Script is Executable
Before running the script, make sure it has the necessary execute permissions.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the following command to make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x breeze.sh
Step 2: Verify Dependencies
The script requires several tools to be available:

openssl
tar
gunzip
Ensure these tools are installed. You can check if they are available by running:

bash
Copy code
openssl version
tar --version
gunzip --version
If any of these tools are not installed, install them using the appropriate package manager:

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo apt install openssl tar gzip
macOS: These tools should already be installed by default, but if not, you can use brew to install them: brew install openssl tar gzip
Step 3: Run the Script
Now that the script is executable, you can run it by passing the encrypted file as an argument.

Make sure the encrypted file (e.g., backup.enc) exists in the same directory or provide the full path.

Run the script as follows:

bash
Copy code
./breeze.sh backup.enc
Replace backup.enc with the name of your actual encrypted backup file.

Step 4: Follow the Prompts
The script will:

Check if the OpenSSL version is 1.1.1.
Decrypt the encrypted backup file.
Extract and modify files inside the backup, including setting a new root password.
Repackage and re-encrypt the modified backup.
It will provide prompts for necessary actions, such as entering a new root password and salt.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the script, such as missing dependencies or permission errors, make sure the required tools are installed and that you have the correct permissions for reading and writing the files.
